# Sales_insights

Full data ana;ysis project with a Power BI Dashborad end
Started with downloading a dataset from kaggle about sales details for an interantional company ,then went through python to clean data and get the dataset ready for the final analysis "Untitled24.ipynb".

Then went through an excel operation to add a final column to sum up all the sales for the products throughout the year.

The final step was creating a Dashborad using PowerBI to finialize all my work in a well shaped Dashborad that clear describe all the sales insights for this well known company throughout the year.
